This webapp is designed to help contextualize hitbox frame data in SSBM, tying it to game concepts. It displays all possible hitboxes that a character can output in a given amount of time, with options to refine the output to meet a user's needs.

DESIGN:
The app is not intended to force any conclusions or even to guide players towards a particular playstyle in any way. It is the user's responsibility to draw meaningful conclusions from the information presented and to apply them to the game.

TECH:
The app is entirely front-end, without any server-side scripts. The "tools" directory holds scripts that assist in gathering and processing frame data, and are not a part of the hosted site (the gh-pages branch).
